# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition

The project focused on developing a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition using Logistic Regression. The dataset used for training and testing the model was imported from the sklearn library, specifically the sklearn.datasets module. After training the model, it achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.72% in classifying handwritten digits. Additionally, a confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the performance of the model, providing insights into its ability to correctly classify digits and identify any potential areas for improvement. Overall, the project demonstrated the effectiveness of Logistic Regression in digit recognition tasks and highlighted the importance of evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
